# Battery-Test-App
This is a stress test routine to determine how long your USB battery will last under use by the vehicle

Copy these 2 files into the root directory for your vehicle code.  When you open up the page from your web browser a text log file is created. When you click on the "Start/ Pause" button the test starts or is paused.  The log file is updated until the page is refreshed so if you let the vehcicel run until the battery fails you will be able to see the results when you power on the vehicle again.
